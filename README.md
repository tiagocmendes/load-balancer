# Load Balancer

Very simples HTTP/TCP Load Balancer.
Implemented in Python3, single thread, using OS selector.
The code contains 4 classes that implement different strategies to select the next back-end server:

1. **N to 1:** all the requests are routed to a single server
2. **Round Robin:** the requests are routed to all servers in sequence
3. **Least Connections:** the request are routed to the server with fewer processed connections
4. **Least Response Time:** the request are routed to the server with less execution time

At the moment only the fist strategy is fully implemented.

## Back-end server

The back-end server was implemented with [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/).
It provides a simple service that computes the number Pi with a certain precision.

## Prerequisites

```console
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run

```console
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ ./setup.sh
```

## How to access the load balancer

Go to a browser and open this [link](http://localhost:8080/100).
The number after the URL specifies the precision of the computation.

## How to Stress Test

```console
$ ./stress_test.sh
```
